# LINE-EM-UP

The game of Line ’em Up is a generic version of tic-tac-toe: it is an adversarial 2 player game played on a n×n
board where each position has one of 4 values:
- a white piece (◦) – for the player who plays the white pieces
- a black piece (•) – for the player who plays the black pieces
- a bloc (⊠) – where no player can place their pieces (in tic-tac-toe, there are no blocs)
- an empty position (□) – where players can place their pieces
